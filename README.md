# [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) working with [Qovery](https://www.qovery.com/) Sample Code

Part of a personal [list](https://github.com/audiBookning/sample-nestjs-codes) of random samples code for NestJS

- Just one App with No service (like, for example, a DB).

- Do not forget to change `.qovery.example.yml` with the relevant data and rename it to `.qovery.yml`

- The NestJS config module is used here but he is not doing anything at the moment.


- The `.env.example` file, like the config module, is not being used yet.
